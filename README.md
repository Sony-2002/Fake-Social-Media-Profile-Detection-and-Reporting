# Fake-Social-Media-Profile-Detection-and-Reporting
Online Social Networks involve a huge amount of people from all over the world and it has 
become a big part of their life. People use social networks to share their feelings, to make 
new friends, to set up new businesses, to connect with friends and family and what not. The 
Online Social Networks provides a great advantage to individuals in different ways but it 
also suffers with some disadvantages. There are many people who use these networks to 
cause harm to others by making fake accounts on these networks. For detection of such fake 
and genuine accounts we can use machine learning algorithms. The machine learning 
algorithms are applied for the prediction and classification of datasets through the different 
models that are prepared. It sometimes become difficult to differentiate between the results 
of different models and so we to use a hybrid approach of machine learning algorithm can 
make this task easy. In our work we compared the 8 different combinations of classification 
algorithms and calculated their accuracy on the dataset of an Online Social Network. We 
used the combination of Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, 
KNN, and Decision Trees. After comparing the result of each hybrid approach, we 
concluded that the best accuracy was obtained by combination of SVM and Logistic 
Regression and Neural Network. So, we proposed a model for the detection of fake account 
with the hybrid approach giving the best accuracy among all the combinations
